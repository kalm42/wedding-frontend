            Kyle and Shelly met on the dating app Coffee Meets Bagel. Kyle made her laugh with a
            cute joke…and they seemed to hit it off. So they met at a local Starbucks and the rest
            is history.
          </p>

          <p>
            Kyle and Shelly love to travel. Hike and camp. They have hiked all over Arizona, Utah,
            Idaho and California visiting many national parks.
          </p>

          <p>
            On Kyle and Shelly’s hike up one of the tallest summits in the world, Mount Kilimanjaro,
            Shelly jokingly said if they can stand sharing a tent after 7 days of hiking without
            showers, they should just get married already ;&#41; Little did she know! On summit day,
            Kyle proposed just before day- break at around 18,500 feet elevation. Shelly said yes of
            course! There is video proof – but honestly you mostly just hear the wicked wind
            whipping around and then an “Oh, babe” and more wind….and given it was just before
            sunrise so you can’t see their Michelin-like coat- layered figures either &#40;which
            Shelly is more than ok with&#41;.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are so happy to share this special day with everyone. Thank you for taking the time
            to celebrate with us!
